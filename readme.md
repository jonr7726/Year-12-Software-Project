This game was a year 12 project made in unity (with C#) to experiment with reversal of time. The game was inspiried by the movie Tenet.

## Time Reversal Mechanics
Time reversal is done by recording object's states each frame and then replaying them in reverse whenever time is reversed. This means interesting puzzles can be created involving, for instance, reversing time to before an enemy closes a door, killing them, and then walking through the door as if it never closed (because now no-one exists to close it). It also adds interesting combat features where bullets can travel in reverse (when moving backwards in time bullets come from the wall behind you, and then return to the enemies gun), and instances where enemies that you have previously killed come back to life when to travel back in time to before you killed them.
